What Is an Inner Join
The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.

Inner Join Example
SELECT suppliers.CompanyName
,ProductName
,UnitPrice
FROM Suppliers INNER JOIN Products
ON Suppliers.supplierid = 
Products.supplierid

Inner Join Syntax
- Join type is specified (INNER JOIN).
- Join condition is in the FROM clause and uses the ON clause.
- Joining more tables together affects overall database perfomance.
- You can join multiple tables, no limit.
- List all the tables, then define conditions.

Inner Joins With Multiple Tables
SELECT o.OrderID, c.CompanyName,
e.LastName
FROM ((Orders o INNER JOIN Customers c ON
o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID)
INNER JOIN Employees e ON o.EmployeeID =
e.EmployeeID);

Best Practices With Joins
- Make sure you are pre-qualifying names.
- Do not make unnecessaryjoins.
- Think about the type of join you are making.
- How are you connecting records?
