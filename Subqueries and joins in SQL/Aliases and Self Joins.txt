What Is an Alias
- SQL aliases give a table or a column a temporary name.
- Make column names more readable.
- An alias only exists for the duration of the query.

SELECT column_name
FROM table_name AS alias_name


Query Example Using Alias
SELECT vendor_name
,product_name
,product_price
FROM Vendors, Products
WHERE Vendors.vendor_id = Products.vendor_id;

Using Alias
SELECT vendor_name
,product_name
,product_price
FROM Vendors AS v, Products AS product_name
WHERE v.vendor_id =p.vendor_id;


Self Joins
- Match customers from the same city.
- Make the tavle and treat it like two separate tables.
- Join the original table to itself

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1 T1, table2 T2
WHERE condition;


Self Join Example
The following SQL statement matches customers that are from the same city:

SELECT A.CustomerName AS
CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS
CustomerName2, A.City
FROM Customers A, Customers B
WHERE A.CustomerID = B.CustomerID
AND A.City = B.City
ORDER BY A.City;
