Best Practices Using Joins
- Check for duplicates.
- Check the number of records each time you make a new join.
- Are you getting the results you expected?
- Start small: one table at a time.


"Slowly Do"
- Think about what you are trying to do first.
- Map how you are joining data tables.
- Think about what your query is trying to do.
- Thinking first now will save time and frustration later.


Use a JOIN Condition
- Cartesian CROSS JOIN.
- INNER JOIN.
- LEFT JOIN.
- RIGHT JOIN.


Joins and Database Performance
- The more tables you join, the slower the database will perform.
- Don't grab unnecessary data if you don't need to.
- Be strategic.
- Take only what you need.


Join Syntax
- Always check the particular syntax for your DBMS.
- Remember SQLite does not do RIGHT and FULL OUTER joins.
