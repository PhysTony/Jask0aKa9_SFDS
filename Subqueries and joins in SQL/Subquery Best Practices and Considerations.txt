Best Practices with Subqueries
- There is no limit to the number of subqueries you can have
- Performance slows when you nest too deeply.
- Subquery selects can only retrieve a single columnm.

Subquery in Subquery
1.Order numbers for toothbrushes.
2. Customer ID's for those orders.
3. Customer information for those orders.

SELECT Customer_name, Customer_contact
FROM Customers
WHERE cust_id IN
	SELECT customer_id
	FROM Orders
	WHERE order_number IN(SELECT order_number
		FROM OrderItems
		WHERE prod_name = 'Toothbrush');
		
PoorSQL Website
- www.poorsql.com (To write legitible and readable queries)
- Website will pre-format code.
- Uses proper indenting.
- Code is easier to read and troubleshoot.

Subqueries for Calculations
Total number of orders placed by every customer

SELECT COUNT (*) AS orders
FROM Orders
WHERE customer_id = '143569';

SELECT customer_name
	,customer_state
	(SELECT COUNT (*) AS orders
	FROM Orders
	WHERE Oriders.customer_id = 
Customer.customer_id) AS orders
FROM customers
ORDER BY Customer_name
