Benefits of Breaking Data into Tables
- Efficient storage.
- Easier manipulation.
- Greater scalability.
- Logically models a process.
- Tables are related through common values (keys)

Joins
- Associate correct records from each table on the fly.
- Allows data retrieval from multiple tables in one query.
- Joins are not physical - they persist for the duration of the query execution.
