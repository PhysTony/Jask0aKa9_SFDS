the right table (table2).

LEFT JOIN Orders O ON C.CustomerID
= O.CustomerID

ORDER BY C.CustomerName;

the left table (table1).
The result is NULL from the left side, when there is no match.

have placed:
SELECT Orders.OrderID
Employees.LastName,
Employees.FirstName

FROM Orders

RIGHT JOIN Employees ON

Left joins can be turned into right joins by reversing the order of the tables.
